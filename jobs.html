    <p>Web developer is a kind of programmer that is a professional in the development of worldwide web applications or applications with the help of programming languages like HTML/CSS, C#. Web developers are usually concerned with the back end of creating a web-application or website (Technopedia.com, 2018). A web developer has some core responsibilities in which they will have to do when they are employed such as designing, coding and modifying websites, layout and function of a website according to a client’s specification. In other words, a web developer is someone who turns a web design into a website by using various lines of codes using variety of coding languages.
    Certainly, there isn’t just one type of web-developer. In the developing world they are classified into three (3) which are; front-end developers, back-end developers and full-stack developers each type of developer focuses on different aspects of developing a website (King, 2018). 
    A front-end developer is someone who takes the design from a client and writes the needed code to implement it on the web using programming languages such as HTML, CSS, etc. On the other hand, a back-end developer is someone who is creates the code which powers the websites databases, server and any other application the website may contain. The vital thing as a back-end developer is to create clean code or programs that can do what you want it to do in the fastest way possible. Finally, a full-stack developer is someone who has
    
    knowledge in both areas of front-end and back-end developing. This means they can oversee the whole process of creating an efficient website (King, 2018).

    <p>A web designer is someone who prepares content for the web and is responsible for the creation of the website structure. This role is principally associated with the styling and layout of pages with content with inclusion of text and images (Technopedia, 2018). In addition to this, a web designer also to select the right fonts, appropriate colors, and right layout. The reason for this is to be able to create a web page which the target market can relate to. For example, an online shopping website which is aimed at different categories of people will have to include attractive pictures, moderate amount of colors, easy-to- read font which is structured for easy readability and access (Technopedia, 2018).
        Additionally, web designers may do things like creating logos, videos, etc. which they will have to tell the developer where these things will be on the page. However, web designers don’t take part in the underlying code and construction of the website, although they may have some knowledge about it (King, 2018).

                As stated above, the main difference between a web developer and a web designer is that, the developer creates the code that will be used to create the website and on the other hand the web designer creates the design the developer will need to follow such as the color scheme, images being used and the content to be included. Above all, it can be seen they both need each other to work effectively.
Undoubtedly, people often consider a web developer as a web designer and vice-versa. Using a clearer example, a web developer is someone who takes the different components of a motorcycle to make it a fully functional one while the designer is someone who creates the design which the developer is supposed to follow and check the convenience of the motorcycle after it has been developed. In other words, the web designer is the architect while developers are the builders.
Firstly, one of the main differences of a web designer to a web developer is the salary difference. As of late 2017, the average salary of a web designer is ranging from $62,000 - $84,000 annually, although it may vary due to other conditions such as location, company background and experience. On the other hand, a web developers salary ranges from $92,000 – $117,000 annually (Mockplus.com, 2017).
Secondly, tool difference. As stated above, web developers work with programming languages such as CSS and HTML to create websites and web applications. In other for this to be successful they make use of software’s like visual studio code, text editors, etc. In comparison, web designers make use of graphic-designing software’s such as adobe photoshop, etc. to create wireframes and prototypes of the website (An, 2018).
Lastly, a web-designer is considered as the more creative job while the development aspect is seen as the logical aspect (An, 2018)
