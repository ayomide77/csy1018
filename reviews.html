                <h1> Visual Studio Code (VSCode)</h1>
                <p> Visual studio code is a free text editor that was developed by Microsoft. It can be run on Windows, MacOS and Linux. VSCode was originally announced as an open source project on GitHub in 2015 and a year later it was released on the web. Ever since, the software has gained huge popularity and reputation among developers and programmers (Vinh Le, 2018). 
                        According to a survey carried out by stack overflow, VSCode was ranked as the most popular development environment with 35% out of 100,000 respondents saying that they use it (Vinh Le, 2018).
                        So, what is so interesting about VSCode that has attracted all these people? Well, it has so many features that enhance the development process.
                        The first thing that the users notice the beautiful User Interface which is also customizable in VSCode. It also allows the users to install useful extensions. Visual Studio Code has an integrated terminal which enhances the workflow of the user. Users can easily push changes to git within VSCode which saves a lot of time that would have been spent on switching from one software to another.

                <h1>Notepad++</h1>
                <p> Notepad++ is a simple but quite powerful text editor (include when it created). It is not the
                    best-looking software, but it still does the job. It is a modification of the Notepad text editor
                    that comes installed in windows laptops. This software is preferred by many due to its simplicity
                    and speed.
                    Although it has been found that some of its users complained that it could be slow sometimes, the
                    developers claim that it is a speedy software due to its low CPU usage (Accuratereviews.com, 2017).
                    Another interesting fact about this software is that it is environment friendly.
                    It sounds absurd, but the developers explained that since the software uses less CPU power,
                    computers can consume less electricity and hence reduction in the amount of carbon dioxide emitted
                    into the environment.
                    Notepad only works in windows machines which is one of the cons of the software.
                    It was created in 2003 by Don Ho and it has been around for quite a while. Even though the software
                    may look too simple, it is quite powerful. It supports 27 programming languages, searches regular
                    extensions and supports syntax highlighting (Download.com, 2014).
                    Another advantage of this software is that it has multi tab functionality which allows the users to
                    have multiple files running at the same time.
                    It also has auto completion which makes development and programming much easier as it saves a lot
                    of time.
                    On the other side, it has its cons which include its inability to support packages. This limits the
                    users in terms of customization.
                    And finally, it can get slow when there are multiple large files opened.

                <h1> What is the Difference </h1>
                <p> The most obvious difference between the two software’s is the appearance. Visual Studio Code looks more appealing due the theme of the development environment rather than that of Notepad++. Also, the user has the option to choose and install different themes that they may like, which shows how flexible Visual Studio Code can be, whereas that option is not available in Notepad++. 
                        Speaking of flexibility, VSCode allows the users to install extensions of their choice and it also gives them the ability to customize their User Interface. This means that the user can customize the almost everything from font-family to line height to font-size among many other things (Vinh Le, 2018).
                        On the technical side, source control integration is an area of difference. Straight out of the box, Notepad++ does not support any source control system although there are plugins available to achieve that. Visual Studio Code on the other hand supports GitHub, one of the three major source control systems (Tim Trott, 2016). This allows the users to work in team on the same files while using VSCode and later, all their changes are merged together automatically. 
                        Considering general tasks, both editors due just fine in editing code. Each of the two software’s is good in its ways. Notepad++ has the edge on performance and speed while VSCode has flexibility and intelligence.
                        For debugging, both editors have the debugging functionality. However, while Notepad++ requires several third-party extensions to be installed which could be a complex thing to do, VSCode has built in debugging support for the Node.js and can debug JavaScript, typescript and any other language that gets transpired to JavaScript.
                        In conclusion, both editors are great and each of them is good in its own ways. It all depends on the needs of the user. Some may need a quick and easy to use text editor while some may need the feature that are available in VSCode depending on the type of task they may be carrying out.
